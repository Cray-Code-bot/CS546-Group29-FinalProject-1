#About LaunchLiving Accommodations

We are a group of students who understand the struggles of searching for living accommodations-- so we invented LaunchLiving. LaunchLiving is an accommodations searching app that removes the need to post revealing information. It puts all relevant information of an accommodation in an easy-to-access space. We hope to take the stress from living accommodations searching so users have more time for the things they enjoy.
